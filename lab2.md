2) Licenses guarantee the right to intellectual property. They also 
   control the methods of distribution, and make sure that profit cannot be 
   made on someone else's work.

3) There is no guarantee that your work will receive credit. It can also 
   be "repossessed" by another individual, only marginally modified and can 
   be repackaged for their own profit.

4) I agree with the multifactorial claims presented in the paper. Social 
   trends were as important to the Web's victory over Gopher as 
   technical superiority.

5) As Android depends significantly on contributions from its userbase, 
   it utilizes a GPL license so that its users can run, study, share, and 
   modify the software. Communities built around the Android Open Source 
   Project continue to develop and distribute modified versions of Android, 
   which is only possible with a free software license such as GPL. 
   However, the reason GPL was used over licenses was likely so that 
   Android could retain some measure of control by placing an obligation to 
   retain a GPL license. This stops derivative works from deviating from 
   the free software goal. It also forces improvements to be shared.

7) GPL is the best license for a company. It requires all users to 
   distribute code under the same terms as the original license, providing 
   a degree of control towards the original company. Android uses GPL as well.

   GPL is also the best for the common good, as it requires contribution 
   towards the singular goal. The best way to ensure progress is to ban 
   leeching.

   Apache is best for developers, as it is slightly permissive but 
   retains patent rights from contributors to users.

9) I'm interested in working on Ghost. Ghost is a blogging platform 
   intended to be used to run an online publication. Users will likely 
   be magazines and journalists. I would use the GPL license, as it 
   requires contribution by users. This is ideal for the progress of the 
   platform.
