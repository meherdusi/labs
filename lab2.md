2) Licenses guarantee the right to intellectual property. They also 
   control the methods of distribution, and make sure that profit cannot be 
   made on someone else's work.

3) There is no guarantee that your work will receive credit. It can also 
   be "repossessed" by another individual, only marginally modified and can 
   be repackaged for their own profit.

4) I agree with the multifactorial claims presented in the paper. Social 
   trends were as important to the Web's victory over Gopher as 
   technical superiority.

5) As Android depends significantly on contributions from its userbase, 
   it utilizes a GPL license so that its users can run, study, share, and 
   modify the software. Communities built around the Android Open Source 
   Project continue to develop and distribute modified versions of Android, 
   which is only possible with a free software license such as GPL. 
   However, the reason GPL was used over licenses was likely so that 
   Android could retain some measure of control by placing an obligation to 
   retain a GPL license. This stops derivative works from deviating from 
   the free software goal.
